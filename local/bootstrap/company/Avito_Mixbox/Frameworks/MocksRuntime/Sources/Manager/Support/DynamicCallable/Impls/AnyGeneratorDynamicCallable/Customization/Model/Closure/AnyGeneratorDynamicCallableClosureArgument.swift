///
/// ```
/// myService.getData(completion: { myData in someProductionCode(myData) })
/// ```
///
/// `CallableClosureArgument` will represent `completion` and calling it will call `someProductionCode`.

/// If `CallableClosureArgument` is called with `CallableClosureArgumentArguments.automatic`

/// The class is designed to make it easy to customize `ClosureArgumentsHandler`.
/// You can simply call it with some arguments (or say that they shoul bee generated automatically).
///
/// Note that return value is ignored, because mocks don't really use it.
