#  Reports

This code was extracted from Avito app, but all Avito specifics was removed (very quickly).

It is used just to view reports on Teamcity CI (in Avito).

It is very far from ideal. Ideally we should have extensible code for reporting in Mixbox that we can use in every app, including Avito,
support custom tags, very custom reporting systems.

I've extracted it quickly, and the source code was also written quickly. Yes, I like to make excuses in comments and documentation.
